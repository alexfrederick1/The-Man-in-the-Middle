# The-Man-in-the-Middle

This project develops a scalable framework to evaluate baseball cutoff play decision-making using anonymized MiLB player and ball-tracking data.
Built a two-model probabilistic system:
Logistic regression to estimate baserunner advancement outcomes
Random Forest classifier (with cross-validation & hyperparameter tuning) to recommend optimal cutoff actions
Integrated predictions with RE24 run expectancy to compute expected run values for every possible decision
Found that cutoff men often favor aggressive throws when holding would reduce run expectancy
Delivered results through an interactive dashboard with team- and player-level insights
This approach provides teams and coaches with actionable analytics to optimize defensive strategy in critical situations.
